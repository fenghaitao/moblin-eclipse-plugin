	* Add more RSE features into plugin feature dependencies
	* Otherwise there is no RSE connection when we select remote deployment

	* Implement remote deployment and remote undeployment by using target 
	* management plug-in.

	* Add InvokeSyncAction.java for that we need to finish "make install"
	* before we could do the remote deployment and undeployment, otherwise
	* there will be a race condition.
	
	* The target managment's upload function does not grant the execute permission,
	* so I write a recursive function to do the deployment.

	* The undeployment is done by a similar recursive way.

	* Initial code commit.

	* This is an Eclipse plug-in for Moblin developers to easily use Moblin SDK.
	* It supports the following features based on Linux Autotools plug-in and
	* target management plug-in.
		* Create an autotool-based C/C++ project for Moblin
		* Import existing autotool-based C/C++ projects for Moblin
		* Build those projects by using Moblin SDK
		* Deploy those projects to Moblin netbook and undeploy from netbook
		* Debug and run the application in the Moblin netbook

	* It has been verified for Eclipse 3.5 and Eclipse 3.5.1.
	* To run this plug-in, you need
		* Install Linux Autools from 
			http://www.eclipse.org/linuxtools/projectPages/autotools/
		* Install Target management from 
			http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/
		* Download Moblin SDK from
